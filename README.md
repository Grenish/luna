# How Luna Works
Luna is a large language model (LLM) that has been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. This allows it to understand and generate human language in a way that is both natural and informative.

When you ask Luna a question, it first tries to understand the meaning of your question. It does this by breaking your question down into its individual parts and analyzing the relationships between those parts. Once Luna has a good understanding of your question, it then searches its knowledge base for the answer. If it finds an answer that is relevant and accurate, Luna will provide it to you.

In addition to answering questions, Luna can also generate different creative text formats. For example, if you ask Luna to write a poem, it will do its best to write a poem that is both original and pleasing to the ear.

# What Luna Can Do
Luna is still in beta testing, but it can already do a variety of things. Here are just a few examples:
1. Answer your questions about a variety of topics, including science, history, current events, and more.
2. Generate different creative text formats, such as poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, and letters.
3. Translate languages.
